Coming to Recipe I'm huge fan of tapioca or saggubiyyam any dish which can be prepared with tapioca will tastes great and mouth watering 😊\n\nToday, I prepared Sabudana karallu which is an authentic South Indian snack recipe main ingredients are rice flour, curd/ yogurt, tapioca, salt, red chilly powder etc.,\n\nI made these Murukullu with very less amount of water because as I soaked tapioca in yogurt for hours so mostly it doesn't require more water. The texture becomes crispy and you could feel crunchiness while having them.\n\nI explained and shown step by step with pictures in below sections. Tapioca Murukullu is my favorite Evening snack but I like to have them any time not only Evening ☺️😉\n\nYou can also pack them in your kids lunch box for snack at evening or with rice.\n\nHope you like it, let's start with Ingredients and follows Procedure\n\n<b><u>Ingredients:</u></b>\n\nRice flour - 450 gms\n\nSoaked tapioca/ Sabudana - 120 gms\n\nCurd / Yogurt - 240 ml\n\nCumin seeds - 1/2 tb sp\n\nSesame seeds - 1/2 tb sp\n\nRed chilly powder - 1/2 tb sp\n\nTurmeric powder - 1/4 tsp\n\nSalt - 1/2 tb sp\n\nWater - 1/4 cup - 60 ml\n\nOil - To deep fry\n\n<b>Things:</b>\n\nMurukku Maker\n\n3 holes round shape stainless steel jali ( shown in picture)\n\n<b><u>Procedure:</u></b>\n\n<b><i><u>Pre-Preparation:</u></i></b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In a bowl Add yogurt/ curd</li>\n\t<li>Mix well</li>\n\t<li>Let them soak for 5 hours</li>\n\t<li>After 5 hours Take one tapioca and press it mashes well</li>\n\t<li>Soaked well</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7372\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3837.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3837\" width=\"1020\" height=\"4196\" />\n\n<b><u>Saggubiyyam / Tapioca Murukullu:</u></b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In a mixing bowl add soaked tapioca, rice flour, salt, red chilly powder, cumin seeds, turmeric powder and sesame seeds</li>\n\t<li>In meantime, heat oil for deep fry on medium heat</li>\n\t<li>Squeeze and mix well</li>\n\t<li>Add little amount of water</li>\n\t<li>Mix well</li>\n\t<li>Make soft and non sticky dough as shown in picture</li>\n\t<li>Divide dough into equal cylinder shape</li>\n\t<li>Put prepared cylinder Shape dough in Murukullu maker</li>\n\t<li>Once oil is hot drop the dough like Murukullu by using Muruku maker</li>\n\t<li>The dough comes out easily from 3 holes round shape plate</li>\n\t<li>Let them fry and flip the other side</li>\n\t<li>Fryboth sides equally</li>\n\t<li>When bubbling reduces Take out tapioca Murukullu from oil</li>\n\t<li>Transfer them on paper towel</li>\n\t<li>Repeat the same process till dough completes</li>\n\t<li>Let them Murukullu become cool</li>\n\t<li>Store them in an airtight container</li>\n\t<li>Serve with rice or snacks at evening</li>\n\t<li>Happy cooking &amp; enjoy your day 😊</li>\n</ul>\n[caption id=\"attachment_7375\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1020\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7375\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_3836.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3836\" width=\"1020\" height=\"9908\" /> Tapioca Murukullu 😋[/caption]\n\n<b><u>Note:</u></b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>While making dough don't add so much of water.
