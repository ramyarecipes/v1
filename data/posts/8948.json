Kids and grown ups love to have tasty and crispy snacks everyday or weekly once at home/ outside. If it is raining ☔️ then it's time to make fried snacks.\n\nToday, I'm sharing fried tapioca balls which is authentic and a recipe from my Mother and it's my favorite snack. We call it 'Saggubiyyam Bonda' which is super crispy outside and soft inside. It mainly contains tapioca ,curd, mixed with salt, chilly, rice flour and some cumin seeds.\n\nMore about this, It is different from other Bonda( fried snack) I say it is \"unique\" because in this recipe no need to add water while making dough.
