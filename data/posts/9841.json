The taste of corn idly is not lesser than the regular ones - sooji idly or curd idly and i can say it’s tastes equally and healthy too. You can’t even find out it is made out of corn 🌽 last week I found this fine corn Rava in an indian store, immediately I got an idea to make Idly out of it because I like corn very much, it tastes sweet, full of fiber and contains nutrients. So, I started it using in Indian Cuisine and it’s gluten free, no need to ferment and also people who are fond of corn can easily love this dish.\n\nThe process is similar to instant sooji idly or perugu Rava idly, shared recipe link in below section. I used few ingredients to make it more yummy you can also include other vegetables or ginger or cashew nuts and more 🙂\n\nLet’s start with ingredients and follows Procedure\n\n<b>Ingredients:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Corn Rava / Broken Corn 🌽 - Fine variety - 1 cup - 160 grams</li>\n\t<li>Mustard seeds - 1/2 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Cumin seeds - 1/2 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Urad dal - 1 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Chana dal - 1 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Curry leaves - 6</li>\n\t<li>Green chilly - 1 - chopped</li>\n\t<li>Onion - finely chopped</li>\n\t<li>Carrot - 1 Tb sp - finely grated</li>\n\t<li>Coriander leaves - 1/2 cup - chopped</li>\n\t<li>Salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Baking soda - 1/8 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Curd - whisked - 1 and 1/2 cups</li>\n\t<li>Oil - 1 Tb sp</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Procedure:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Add oil on medium heated pan then add in mustard seeds, cumin seeds, urad dal, Chana dal, curry leaves and green chilly.
