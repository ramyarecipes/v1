Raw😟 Yes you read correct some of the leafy vegetables you can eat directly by adding them in salad 🥗 or in curries. They are spinach, cilantro, parsley, rosemary, lettuce, kale etc., let's see how it helps and usages...\n\n<b>For example: </b>coriander or cilantro you can have it on any salad, dressing, curries, Dal or Sambar etc.,Take one more example spinach, yes you can eat it directly or stir fry on salad or curries or with rice\n\nNext lettuce, wow such a beautiful leaf and juicy too. Many of you ate burger right in it they add lettuce in burger 🍔 isn't it tasty?\n\nMy suggestion if you haven't had these three leafy vegetables directly in salad or any curry do try I hope sure you will like them. Most important healthy and works out full in your tummy 😉\n\nComing to Recipe today I'm using leafy vegetable that is drumstick leaves.
