All these curries which I was prepared are the same process following from many generations and learnt from grand-grand parents. It’s like a chain process and love to know more and more from them.\n\nCurry is a side dish either wet/ dry prepared out of vegetables/ leafy vegetables. It should be cooked and make sure it contain some amount of nutrients in it for good health diet. You can dip roti in curry and eat, you feel the taste of curry with flavours and it really delicious 😋\n\nIn South Indians meal common recipe should be a side dish in every meal, this Pachadi suits with any rice/curd rice/ fresh hot rice with ghee if you like to have it with any phulka/ Roti then it’s great combination 👍\n\nComing to Recipe, I don’t know how many of you know Bottle Gourd or tasted it or love this vegetable, but I like this a lot in any form either it could be fry, stir fry, curry or mix in Dal.
