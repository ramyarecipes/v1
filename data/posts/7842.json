All these curries which I was prepared are the same process following from many generations and learnt from others like grand-grand parents. It's like a chain process and love to know more and more from grand parents.\n\nCurry is a side dish either wet/ dry prepared out of vegetables/ leafy vegetables. It should be cooked and make sure it contain some amount of nutrients in it for good health diet. You can dip roti in curry and eat, you feel the flavours of it really delicious 😋\n\nIn South India it’s common recipe and should be a side dish in every meal, this Dal suits with any rice/jeera rice/ fresh hot rice with ghee if you like to have it with any phulka/ Roti then it’s great combination 👍\n\nComing to Recipe, I don't know how many of you know snake Gourd or tasted it or love this vegetable, but I like this a lot in any form either it could be fry, stir fry, curry or mix in Dal. If anyone of you doesn't taste yet must try!\n\nToday I prepared Dal with snake gourd and it is a no onion garlic recipe, if you're in vrat / pooja , you can have it nicely.\n\n<b>Nutrition facts:</b>\n\n<b>Snake Gourd:</b>  Vitamins A &amp; C.
