Mostly you can see at traditional Indian weddings buffet or during festivals . It is very tender, delicious and easy recipe can make just in 10 minutes 😯 As everyone’s favorite I made it with generous amount of indian spice masala powder. Brinjal is also well known as Eggplant 🍆 we call it as “vankaya”.\n\nI love this Stir Fry prepared with aromatic flavor of garlic  and tremendous homemade masala powder. Brinjal should cook perfectly otherwise it becomes mushy and if  happens, it spoils the texture of Eggplant. Do follow my Procedure and make an amazing side dish with Brinjal and enjoy with dal and piping hot rice 🍚 with a dollop of ghee or you can have it with rice 🍚. In Both ways it tastes great 👍\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9799\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_8931.jpg\" alt=\"img_8931\" width=\"3072\" height=\"4096\" />\n\nLet’s start with Ingredients and follows Procedure\n\n<b>Ingredients:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Vankayallu / Eggplants 🍆 - 15 - chopped</li>\n\t<li>Mustard seeds - 1/2 tsp</li>\n\t<li>Cumin seeds - 1 tsp</li>\n\t<li>Curry leaves - 5</li>\n\t<li>Salt - 1/4 tsp ( to cook Brinjal)</li>\n\t<li>Coconut oil - 1 Tb sp ( if you wish, you can use regular cooking oil or butter )</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Masala Powder:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dry coconut pieces / desiccated coconut - 1/3 cup</li>\n\t<li>Dry red chillies - 5 or red chilly flakes - 1 Tb sp</li>\n\t<li>Red chilly Powder - 1/4 teaspoon</li>\n\t<li>Salt - 1/2 tsp</li>\n\t<li>Garlic cloves - 3</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Procedure:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Add in oil, mustard and cumin seeds, curry leaves and chopped eggplants 🍆 on medium heated pan</li>\n\t<li>Saute 2 minutes and add 1/4 cup of water, salt 1/4 teaspoon, cook 5-7 minutes by covering with lid</li>\n\t<li>After that, make masala powder into coarsely by adding in mixer</li>\n\t<li>Then add masala powder on cooked Brinjal, gently mix and cover with lid</li>\n\t<li>Let it cook for about 1-2 minutes on low heat, turn off heat and serve</li>\n\t<li>Eggplant 🍆 Stir Fry is ready to serve</li>\n\t<li>Happy Cooking and Have a lovely day 🙂</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Step by step process shown below with pictures:</b>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9797\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/untitled-design-3.png\" alt=\"untitled-design-3\" width=\"1880\" height=\"1576\" />\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9798\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/untitled-design-4.png\" alt=\"untitled-design-4\" width=\"1880\" height=\"1576\" />\n\n<b>Follow us:</b>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/ramyarecipes/\"> Facebook </a>\n</strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ramyarecipes2017/\">Instagram</a></strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ramyarecipes/\"> Twitter </a></strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114706555425633310625\"> Google+</a></strong>\n\nShare your comments in below section, I like to know your opinion\n\n© 2017- 2019 Ramyarecipes","categories":["curries","lunch","ramyarecipes","vankaya-vepudu-brinjal-stir-fry"],"tags":["andhra-recipes","blogger","brinjal","brinjal-stir-fry","egg-plant","eggplant-recipes","food-blog","indian-cuisine","indian-food","ramya-recipes","recipes","south-indian-food","south-indian-recipes","telugu-vantalu","vankaya-vepudu","vepudu"],"comments":"10","thumbnail":"","attachments":null}
