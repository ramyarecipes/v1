Tada! You’re done and ready to dip in with <a href=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/masala-puri-%f0%9f%98%8b%f0%9f%98%80-street-food-south-india/\">Mint / Sweet Chutney</a>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9989\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/img_9555.jpg\" alt=\"img_9555\" width=\"3072\" height=\"2049\" />\n\nTraditionally, this starter used to cook in tandoori but I made them in the oven. Fortunately, they turned out super delicious and tasted the same as dabha / restaurant style recipe. It’s completely vegetarian and people who would like to make chicken tikka can follow the same process and you need to replace paneer ☺️ I can definitely assure you “paneer Tikka tastes awesome”.
