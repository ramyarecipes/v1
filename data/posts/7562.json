Most of the special laddu's prepared with flour, sugar and combined with other ingredients next deep fried in oil and adds in sugar syrup.\n\nThere are many sweet recipes originated from India like Boondi Laddu, Malai Laddu, Motichoor Laddu, Rava Laddu, Besan Laddu etc., types of Laddu varies from one state to another.\n\nI posted Besan Laddu on special festival Ganesh Chaturthi and other sweet recipes on Dussehra festival, you can check links at the end.\n\nNow a days, Kids lacking of healthy food so I prepared peanuts laddu and dry fruit Laddu which are rich in iron and calcium. They are simple to make and healthy Laddu(s) to taste which are loved by specially children/ kids.\n\nThese laddu's are traditional in South India I have seen my grand mother used to prepare when we were kids, usually on every vacation we visited grand mother's home. Those days are lovely and cherished moments forever in my life ☺️\n\nWhile packing lunch box to your kids, instead of chocolates or potato chips sometimes change their snack recipes by serving healthy laddu's either peanuts Laddu or dry fruit Laddu.
