It is a mixed combination of taste sometimes sweet &amp; tangy or might be sour.\n\nMy suggestion is to include kiwi fruit 🥝 in your daily diet because it's provides many healthy benefits.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8690\" src=\"https://ramyarecipesblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_5893.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5893\" width=\"1462\" height=\"2048\" />\n\n<b>Health Benefits of Kiwi :</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A kiwifruit has almost<b><i> twice as much vitamin C than 2 oranges 🍊 </i></b>of equal weight. Although vitamin C helps with many health deficiencies and problems.</li>\n\t<li>The amount of <b><i>fiber in a kiwi is almost as much as in 3 celery sticks</i></b>. Fiber is extremely important for so many reasons but is key for the digestive system to function properly.</li>\n\t<li><b><i>As much vitamin E as in 3 apples 🍎 </i></b> The major benefits of vitamin E are for building strong immunity, healthy looking skin and eye health. Many people take vitamin E supplements for antioxidants, which protect cells from damage.</li>\n\t<li>A kiwifruit has almost <b><i>as much potassium as a large mango.</i></b></li>\n\t<li>A <b><i>kiwifruit has the same amount of folate as found in 4 peaches</i></b>. Folate is the most important nutrient for producing and maintaining new cells. This makes it especially important during pregnancy and for babies. It’s important for adults as well because it’s necessary for normal blood cell production as well.</li>\n</ul>\nToday, I prepared kiwi jam which turned out so creamy, glazy and tasty too.\n\nLet's start with ingredients and follows Procedure\n\n<b>Jam recipe: Kiwi fruit 🥝 </b>\n\n<b>Quantity yields : 400 gms (at the end of processing jam)</b>\n\n<b>Duration: 20 mins</b>\n\n<b>Ingredients:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kiwi Fruit - Fresh - 7 - 600 gms - peeled off &amp; chopped</li>\n\t<li>Granulated Sugar - 420 gms</li>\n\t<li>Honey - 1 tb sp</li>\n\t<li>Lemon juice - 1/2 tb sp</li>\n\t<li>Vanilla Essence - 1 tsp</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Procedure:</b>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Add chopped kiwi in juicer &amp; make smooth puree</li>\n\t<li>Heat a heavy bottom non stick pan over medium heat</li>\n\t<li>Add sugar &amp; kiwi 🥝 puree, mix well</li>\n\t<li>Stir continuously till sugar dissolves</li>\n\t<li>Next add honey, lemon juice &amp; vanilla essence .
